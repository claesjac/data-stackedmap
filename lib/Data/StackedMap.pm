=head1 NAME

Data::StackedMap - An object that stores key/value pairs in a stacked fashion

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Data::StackedMap;
    
    my $data = Data::StackedMap->new();

    $data->set("foo" => 10);
    print $data->get("foo"); # prints '10'

    $data->push();
    print $data->get("foo"); # still prints '10'
    
    $data->set("foo" => 20);
    print $data->get("foo"); # now prints '20'
    
    $data->pop();
    print $data->get("foo"); # prints '10' again

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements a simple key/value map where each key can exist multiple times in different 
layers in a stack.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new ( I<$default_hash> )

Creates a new instance of this class. The first layer of the stack can be pre-populated by passing 
a hash ref (I<$default_hash>) whos keys and values will be copied.

=back

=head2 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item exists ( $key )

Checks if data with the key I<$key> exists anywhere in the stack. Returns the layer (from the top) 
in which the key is first found. -1 for top-most layer, -2 for second top-most layer and so forth. 
Returns 0 if the key is not found at all.

=item delete ( $key )

Deletes the value of I<$key> at the top of the stack. If an entry with the same key exists down the 
stack C<get> and C<exists> will operate on that value.

=item get ( $key )

Returns the value of I<$key> or undef it the key doesn't exist. Will search down the stack 
to find the value.

=item set ( $key => $value )

=item put ( $key => $value ) 

Sets the value of I<$key> to I<$value>.

=item keys ()

Returns a list of the keys defined in all layers of the stack.

=item top_keys ()

Returns a list of the keys defined in just the top layer of the stack.

=item push ()

Creates a new current map in the stack.

=item pop ()

Removes the current stack entry and returns it. Will throw an error if called when there is only 
one map in the stack.

=item size ()

Returns the length of the stack, i.e. how many layers deep it currently is.
